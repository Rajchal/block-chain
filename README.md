# BlockChain Project

Welcome to the BlockChain Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive implementation of blockchain technology.

## Features

- Create and manage transactions
- Generate blocks and add them to the blockchain
- Mine blocks to find a valid nonce
- Verify transactions using public and private keys

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Rajchal/block-chain.git
    cd block-chain
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Compile the TypeScript code:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to create wallets and send money between them:

```typescript
const Anjal = new Wallet();
const Ell = new Wallet();
const Anj = new Wallet();

Anjal.sendMoney(50, Ell.publicKey);
Ell.sendMoney(23, Anj.publicKey);
Anj.sendMoney(5, Ell.publicKey);

console.log(Chain.instance);

# Blockchain Application

This is a simple blockchain application implemented in TypeScript. It demonstrates basic concepts of blockchain technology, including transactions, blocks, and mining.

## Features

- **Decentralized**: No central authority.
- **Secure**: Uses cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions.
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible to all participants.
- **Tamper-proof**: Once added, transactions cannot be altered.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-project.git
cd blockchain-project
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the blockchain application, run the following command:

```bash
npm toJs
node index.js
```
